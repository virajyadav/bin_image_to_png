# bin_image_to_png



This Python code reads in raw image data from a binary file, converts the data into RGB format using OpenCV, and writes the resulting RGB images to disk as PNG files. The raw image data is assumed to have a fixed width and height, and a specified data type (in this case, np.uint8).

To use this code, simply place the raw image data in a binary file called "raw_images.bin" and run the script. The script will automatically iterate over each image in the file, convert it to RGB, and write it to disk as a PNG file with a filename of the form "image_{i}.png", where i is the index of the image in the file.

Note that the expected size of each image is calculated based on the specified width and height. If the actual size of an image in the input file does not match the expected size, the script will print an error message and skip that image.

To run this code, you will need to have NumPy and OpenCV installed in your Python environment.
